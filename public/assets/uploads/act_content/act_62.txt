Barong Dance will bring you back to Balinese mythology telling you the story about the fight between good and evil. The barong - a strange creature (half shaggy dog, half lion, propelled by two men like a circus clown - horse) is certainly not the sort of thing you’d like to meet on midnight stroll through the rice paddies.</div><div><br></div><div><b>-Ubud Monkey Forest </b>- The cultural sanctuary that maintains harmony between humans, nature and the cosmos. Get lost in this limitless tropical forest with around 700 monkeys. Be ready for lots of attention from those naughty little cuties! And of course - get a good dose of fresh air while chasing them. If thinking about it makes you excited, imagine actually doing it!</div><div><br></div><div><b>-Tegalalang Rice Terraces </b>- When was the last time you did something for the first time? Prepare your cameras for the perfect Bali photo opportunity - dramatic rice terraces views. Let yourself drift into the breathtaking greenery. Escape the ordinary and have a wonderful day in the green surroundings of Bali!</div><div><br></div><div><b>-Batur Volcano</b> - There are no doubts that Batur Volcano will be the highlight of your vacation! Just tell yourself - “adrenaline and adventure, here I come” and climb into this stunning creature of nature to see impressive views from the very top of the mountain. You will be sure that your adventures take you further than your fears and you will push your thirst for adrenaline!</div><div><br></div><div><b>-Coffee Plantation</b> - It is said that travelling leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.

Don’t forget to have your cup of Luwak!</div><div><br></div><div>-<b>Tirta Empul Temple</b> - Run towards adventure and not away from it! Tirta Empul Temple can become one of them.
